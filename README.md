This repository contains a Databricks notebook used to build a dimensional data lakehouse using the Northwind dataset.

# Contents

- .csv and .json: Raw source files used in project.

- Demonstrates ETL pipeline using Databricks.
- Uses Delta tables across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

# To Run
1. Upload all files to a Databricks workspace (or open the notebook directly in Databricks).
2. File paths should match that in the notebook (e.g., /Volumes/workspace/default/northwind_schema/...).
